Python Code to find the roots of a Cubic Equation

Useful Information about the script :
  Let's assume you want to find the roots of the equation 6x^3+2x^2+9x-2=0
  Steps->
     i) Run the python code roots.py.
     ii) The user interface will look like this:
          Enter the coefficients of the cubic equation one by one
          Enter the coefficient of x^3:
          6
          Enter the coefficient of x^2:
          2
          Enter the coefficient of x:
          9
          Enter the constant:
          -2
          Solution of the cubic equation:
          [ 0.20681917+0.j         -0.27007625+1.24047278j -0.27007625-1.24047278j]
